Bringing people together since 2018, MoveMe is the all in one app for getting involved in your local community.

MoveMe was created to provide people easy access to find and join political or community events. Users are prompted to enter his/her zipcode and MoveMe will generate upcoming events from the Meetup.com and the location from Google Maps. We have also created a chat feature for MoveMe users to connect with other users online.

All these elements combine to create a user experience that is both functional and intuitive.

## Getting Started

The first screenshot displays a table of item id, product name, quantity and price. Here, the user is prompted to enter the item id and quantity they wish to purchase.

The second screenshot shows the total price and updated table after the user's purchase. Then the user is prompted to purchase other items.
