# bamazon
Bamazon is a marketplace where users view products, prices and inventory. Users input the item id they would like to purchase and the number of units. Then, Bamazon will calculate the total price and deduct the stock quantity. 

## Getting Started

The first screenshot displays a table of item id, product name, quantity and price. Here, the user is prompted to enter the item id and quantity they wish to purchase.
